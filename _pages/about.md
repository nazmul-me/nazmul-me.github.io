I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at [North Carolina State University](https://csc.ncsu.edu). My primary research interests are Software Engineering, Software Security, AI, specifically, LLM for Code, Software Repository Mining using Machine Learning and Deep Learning with the aim of Software Maintenance.

I have completed my B.Sc and M.Sc (with a fellowship from the ICT division, Bangladesh) in Software Engineering from the [Institute of Information Technology (IIT)](http://www.iit.du.ac.bd), University of Dhaka. I am an Assistant Professor at the [CSE department](https://cse.iutoic-dhaka.edu/profile/nazmulhaque/education), Islamic University of Technology, Bangladesh, a subsidiary organ of OIC since April 2023.
